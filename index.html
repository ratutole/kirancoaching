        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p><strong>Hi, I’m Bandisha — Somatic Attachment & Relationship Coach</strong></p>
        <p>
          I founded Kiran Coaching in honor of my father. The word <em>Kiran</em> means “ray of light,”
          capturing the essence of healing: gently removing layers of pain so you can step fully into your own light.
        </p>
        <p>
          While my name is Bandisha, my practice is called Kiran Coaching — a reminder that the light within us
          shines even when hidden.
        </p>
        <p>
          I combine somatic attachment healing, nervous system regulation, and subconscious reprogramming to support
          you in feeling safe, connected, and whole.
        </p>

    <h2>WHY YOU’RE HERE</h2>
    <p><strong>You're Not Broken. You're Adapting.</strong></p>
    <p>Most relationship struggles aren’t because you’re failing—they’re because your nervous system and subconscious
      mind adapted to protect you.</p>
    <div class="card-list">
      <div class="card">
        <p>Repeating painful patterns in love or family</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <p>Feeling anxious, overwhelmed, or shut down in intimacy</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <p>Attracting emotionally unavailable partners</p>

      <div class="card">
        <p>Craving closeness but feeling unsafe with it</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>These are not flaws. They are survival strategies.</p>
    <p>I combine relationship coaching with somatic attachment healing and subconscious reprogramming to help you feel
      safe in your body, confident in your truth, and secure in your connections.</p>

    <h2>WHAT YOU’LL GAIN</h2>
    <p><strong>In Our Work Together, You’ll Learn To:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Heal attachment wounds and stop repeating painful patterns</li>
      <li>Rewire your nervous system for safety and connection</li>
      <li>Reprogram your beliefs around love, worth, and safety</li>
      <li>Communicate clearly, without shrinking or shutting down</li>
      <li>Set boundaries that honor you and feel safe to hold</li>
      <li>Understand and ask for your needs—without shame</li>
      <li>Soothe your emotions instead of spiraling or shutting down</li>
      <li>Build secure relationships that don’t cost your selfhood</li>
      <li>Embody deep confidence, self-trust, and self-worth</li>
    </ul>
    <p>→ This is a return to wholeness—not a performance of strength.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="reprogram-section">
    <h2>REPROGRAM YOUR MIND. REWIRE YOUR BODY. REWRITE YOUR STORY.</h2>
    <p>The beliefs you hold—about your worth, your loveability, your safety—were shaped long ago, before you had
      language.</p>

    <p><strong>Common core beliefs might include:</strong></p>
    <ul class="belief-cards">
      <li>“I have to be perfect to be loved.”</li>
      <li>“If I express myself, I’ll be rejected.”</li>
      <li>“I’m too much.”</li>
      <li>“I’m not enough.”</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These beliefs don’t just live in your thoughts — they live in your nervous system: your breath, posture, impulses
      to shrink or control.</p>

    <p><strong>In this work, we gently release these beliefs and you’ll experience:</strong></p>
    <ul class="experience-cards">
      <li>Real self-worth — rooted in presence, not performance</li>
      <li>Secure confidence — grounded and embodied, not performative</li>
      <li>True self-esteem — built from inner safety, not outer validation</li>
      <li>New stories — about who you are and what love can feel like</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This isn’t about fixing you. It’s about remembering who you were before the world taught you to forget.</p>

    <h2>THREE CORE RELATIONSHIPS WE TRANSFORM</h2>

    <div class="relationship-grid">
      <article>
        <h3>1. Your Relationship With Yourself</h3>
